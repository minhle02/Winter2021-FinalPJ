<h1>Winter 2021 Final Solution</h1>
<h2>1) Generic Quicksort</h2>
A simple class <code>People</code> with <code>compareTo()</code>
method is used to test the implemented generic Quicksort. 
Result of the test is written out to <code>SortedList.txt</code>in
<code>output</code> folder

<h2>2) Emergency Room Management Program</h2>
A simple management program for emergency room waitlist is implemented
using a generic <code>ArrayList</code> and a custom <code>Patient</code>
class. The program modifies waiting list based on the severity 
of cases, which means severe patients will be prioritized. It also allows 
staff to access and modify data of all patients.
